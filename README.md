Module 4 Challenge

# Background
The main objective of this analysis was to help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. I was given two initial datasets and standardized test scores for reading and math. In order to showcase trends in school performance, I had to aggregate these two initial datasets:

schools_complete.csv which contained each school’s:
•	School ID, School Name, Type, Size, and Budget

students_complete.csv which contained each student’s:
•	Student ID, Student Name, Gender, Grade, School Name, Reading Score, and Math Score

After combining the datasets into a single dataset called school_data_complete, there were 15 unique schools with a total of 39,170 students all together.

# Pandas and Jupyter Notebook
Using python, pandas, and Jupyter Notebook, I merged the files into a single dataset, and utilized pandas DataFrames, pandas pd.cut, groupby, sort_values, and many other techiniques to analyze the data and discover useful trends.

The main file for the analysis is called "PyCitySchools_main.ipynb" and is located in the PyCitySchools folder.

# Written Report
A written report of the analysis is included in a microsoft word doc called "pandas-challenge Written Report"
